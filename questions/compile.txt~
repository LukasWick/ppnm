1. The main method is the method that is run when the script is run. (When the .exe file is run) Without it the code would compile to a dll file that could not be run
2. Source code is code we can read ad write in (.cs). bytecode (.dll or .exe) is the translation of the source-code into the instructions for an abstract processor realised by a runtime-system (mono). If it contais a main and is a ready program it becomes an executable (exe)
3. To make a complete code eg hello.cs into an executable byte code you can copile it using mcs hello.cs 
4. You can run it using mono hello.exe
5. cmath.cs into a bytecode library cmath.dll?: 

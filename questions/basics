3: Rewrite this piece of code, x=(a>b?a:b), using the if statement.
    if (a>b){
        x = a;
    }
    else{
        x = b; 
    }
4: If you need mathematical functions from, say, cmath.dll library, how do you link your program with the library?
    Give mcs the flag -reference:cmath.dll
5: What will the following piece of code print?
int i=0;
Write("{0}\n",i);
Write("{0}\n",i++);
Write("{0}\n",++i);
Explain.
    It will print: 
    0
    0
    2
    
    The first is trivial, the second it will first print then add 1, and in the second it will add one more and then print 
6: Rewrite the loop while(condition)body using the for loop.
    for (init;condition;inc) {body}
    The task dose not realy make sense since the part incrimenting and changing the conditoion is part of body.
7: Rewrite the loop for(init;cond;inc)body using the while loop.
    init;
    while(cond){
        inc;
        body;}
8: Rewrite the loop do body while(condition); using the for loop.
    body;
    for(condition){body;}
    Same problem as 6
